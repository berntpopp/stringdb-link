"""Tool-name compliance with the GeneFoundry Tool-Naming Standard v1.

Every registered tool must be unprefixed, snake_case, <= 50 chars, and start with
a canonical verb so it composes cleanly behind the ``genefoundry-router`` gateway,
which mounts this server under the ``stringdb`` namespace (tools surface as
``stringdb_<tool>``). Guards against future drift -- tool names here are generated
by ``FastMCP.from_fastapi`` from each route's ``operation_id``, so a new route can
silently introduce a non-compliant tool. See issue berntpopp/stringdb-link#1.
